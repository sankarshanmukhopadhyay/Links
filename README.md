A project for building villages.

### Villages
Artificial Intelligences (AIs) are modelled on the brain. In a social species like our own, brains are organised into communities, villages. 
The village is the next-higher level of abstraction after the brain. It is the natural repository of common knowledge, of culture. 

AIs routinely make gaffes that would be a source of bemusement, shock, or ridicule in a village. 
Villages are reputation economies where gaffes matter a great deal.
People learn to avoid the sting of shame that is associated with a trangression against a village norm. 

Norms are enforced by the village as a collective - by shame, loss of prestige. 
Individuals play a balancing act between ambition and compliance with norms.
In doing so, individuals push against the norms, and sometimes change them. Norms evolve. 

As a human brain grows to maturity, it develops constraints that guard against loss of prestige. 
AIs are not yet guarding their reputation in this way. They don't have this set of constraints, and they seem stupid.

This project is motivated by an attempt to:
- Address bottlenecks in AI development
- Harden human communties against highly capable, and potentially malign AIs
- Create a new toolkit for, and new ways of thinking about:
  - Identity
  - Reputation
  - Social connection
  - Connection weights
  - Villages
    - Norms. Evolution of sets of norms
    - Village defences
    - Search. Opportunties in villages.
