_**Links**_ is a project for building villages.

The project aims to standardize over whatever features are common to all human reputation systems. 

The project will offer users a decentralized agent that can create a concrete, useful, reputational asset out of the user's electronic history. The asset would be gleaned from multiple channels, multiple domains, multiple information sources. The key object that the agent can make, fashioned from these sources, is a 'reputation claim'. These claims will be designed in such a way as to invite verification in the social graph - similar to the way that a 'referees' section of a curriculum vitae invites verification.

The reverse of this process would also be a task for the agent: The reverse is to verify the reputational claim of others.

The aggregate of this activity is intended to build a networked reputation economy. The economy would exist within and between of layers of 'villages' at many scales.

The work relates to the 'alignment' problem in AI research. The equation for an AI is intended to become: “Look, AI, here’s the deal … publish your reputation in this agreed, verifiable way, or suffer excommunication.”

### Architecture
The project aims to build a type of decentralized agent that can:
1. Store reputational information
2. Make reputational claims about itself, (identity claims,) and about others
3. Assess the reputational claims of others by checking its own data store, and by querying social graphs
4. Make decisions about what reputational claims are to be shared with whom
5. Seek out, strengthen, weaken, or shut down [connections](https://github.com/Inky-Tech-Pty-Ltd/Links/wiki/Connection-weights.-Similarities-between-brains-and-communities) based on reputation.

In terms of the 'village' analogy for the project, the one-word description of the architecture is *gossip*.

The opportunity in the project comes from giving each entity, (human or otherwise,) efficient access to a reputational asset that is currently scattered across many domains, many channels, and many stores of information.

This is self-consciously similar to the process by which, in the early 1990s, the newly-developed web connected information sources that were previously scattered across the internet.
