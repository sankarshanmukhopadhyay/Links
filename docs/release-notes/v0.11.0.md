# v0.11.0 — Governance Complete: Substrate + Observability + Ops Readiness

This release is a cohesive increment that rounds out the Links roadmap set across:
- Governance & policy evolution (quorum, lifecycle, diff, rollback/versioning)
- Distributed policy substrate (signed manifests, integrity metadata, pagination, reconciliation, anchors)
- Assurance & observability (audit export, classification hooks, signed digests, drift checks, transparency)
- Operational hardening (atomic-ish writes, deployment profiles, container-ready baseline, load harness)
- Security & risk controls (expiry support, replay protection, quotas, signed denials, crypto agility scaffolding)
- Ecosystem & interoperability (registry import/export, Python client/SDK, examples, conformance tests)

## Highlights

### Governance & Policy Evolution
- Weighted and role-based quorum support, plus explicit quorum metadata in policy update artifacts.
- Lifecycle states: `proposal → approved → active`, with machine-readable change summaries.
- Versioning/rollback semantics with activation time/height support.

### Distributed Policy Substrate
- Signed policy feed manifests with integrity metadata (Merkle root + hash-chain head).
- Pagination for large policy histories and reconciliation/fork reporting primitives.
- Trust anchor registry with register/rotate/revoke workflows.

### Assurance & Observability
- Audit export endpoints and CLI (`links audit export`) supporting JSON/CSV.
- SHA-256 digest generation and optional digest signing with the node key.
- Drift check CLI (`links drift check`) with severity classification and webhook hook.
- Signed transparency log (append-only) for policy head publishing.

### Operational Hardening
- Atomic-ish filesystem writes for village state.
- Deployment profiles in `docs/deploy/` and container-ready baseline `Dockerfile`.
- Minimal load test harness in `scripts/`.

### Security & Risk Controls
- Replay protection for already-ingested bundle IDs.
- Village-level submission quota enforcement (policy-driven).
- Signed denial artifacts for rejection decisions (best-effort).
- Crypto agility scaffolding: signature entries now carry an `alg` field.

### Ecosystem & Interoperability
- Minimal external registry import/export commands.
- Python HTTP client wrapper (`links.client`) and SDK surface (`links.sdk`).
- Example snapshot script and conformance test starter.

## Upgrade notes
- If you enable digest signing, set `LINKS_NODE_SIGNING_KEY_B64` (base64 Ed25519 seed).
- Public policy endpoint is opt-in via `LINKS_PUBLIC_POLICY=1` or `policy.public_policy_endpoint=true`.
